FIXED - 1) If you save a map, then reload it, and then try to save it again, and then try to reload it again, it will cause some sort of crash.
FIXED - 2) drawing ice and grown from bottom left to top right will crash the program.  Same with top right to bottom left.  Just avoid those corners and you're solid.

to pause the action, hit the '`' button on your keyboard three times.
to change what you are drawing, hit the right mouse button
drawing occurs in this order:
1) player FIXED - which doesn't work so you'll have to add a player to the map manually
2) enemies
3) ground
4) ice

to save, hit S button on your keyboard.

there is no way to delete anything once it is placed, and there is no way to stop drawing a ground/ice once it is in action.  you're stuck with it.  drawing too small will cause the whole thing to fail.

FIXED - also, i don't know why it doesn't draw ground and ice where you actually drew it... ver .00004 will address this proble.

when you save a map, it will appear in C:\Documents and Settings\[user]\Application Data\LOVE\World-B\TEXT.TXT
in Vista (lol) C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Roaming\LOVE\World-B\TEXT.TXT

If you want to start over, just delete this file.  Don't delete the TEXT.TXT in the program files\love\world-b directory though, unless you want to change the filename in map.lua.

THAT IS ALL GOOD DAY TO YOU.
