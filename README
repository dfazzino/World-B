Added an E item to the map.dat file.  
Added code to map.lua in generatemap() to send enemy data over to enemy.lua
Added CreateEnemy() to enemy.lua to create entries in the enemy table for AI processing.  Also added code to call ApplyImpulse() in physicsg.
Added code to physicsg; changed table.insert for bodies and shapes to include a manually set index.  This index is utilized in this commit by enemy:MoveEnemies() to shoot an enemy clear off the left of the map where nobody will see it again.  Basically the easiest enemy ever.
