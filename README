World B says:  All your Material A are belong to us.

to pause the action, hit the '`' button on your keyboard three times.
to change what you are drawing, hit the right mouse button
drawing occurs in this order:
1) player
2) enemies
3) ground
4) ice

to save, hit S button on your keyboard.

there is no way to delete anything once it is placed, and there is no way to stop drawing a ground/ice once it is in action.  you're stuck with it.  drawing too small will cause the whole thing to fail.

when you save a map, it will appear in C:\Documents and Settings\[user]\Application Data\LOVE\World-B\TEXT.TXT
in Vista (lol) C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Roaming\LOVE\World-B\TEXT.TXT

If you want to start over, just delete this file.  Don't delete the TEXT.TXT in the program files\love\world-b directory though, unless you want to change the filename in map.lua.

THAT IS ALL GOOD DAY TO YOU.
