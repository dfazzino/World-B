--contains any events that can happen in the map; will most likely not be used for a long time.  basically 
this is for scripting the map so it's not just static.

examples: platformX moves at speedY, between locations X1,Y1 and X2,Y2
	thirty seconds into the map, create a monster at X,Y
     when player passes X, collapse map objects 1-50, which have been passed
     when player stands on objectX, a platform is lowered, shooting it raises it again.
